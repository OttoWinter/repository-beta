## About

JupyterLab is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share
documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.
Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation,
statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.

This add-on runs JupyterLab, which is the next-generation user interface for
Project Jupyter. It is an extensible environment for interactive and
reproducible computing, based on the Jupyter Notebook and Architecture.
