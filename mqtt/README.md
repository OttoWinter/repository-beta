Mosquitto MQTT Server bundled with Hivemq's web client.

## Deprecation warning

**This add-on is in a deprecated state!**

This add-on is now deprecated. We highly recommend on switching to the
official Home Assistant Mosquitto add-on as an alternative.

This add-on will soon be removed from the add-on store.

## About

This add-on combines the power of [Hivemq][hivemq]'s
web-based MQTT client, and the powerful [Mosquitto][mosquitto]
broker (MQTT Server). With this, you can host your own MQTT server,
and inspect/publish messages using the built-in web client!
