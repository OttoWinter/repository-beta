[Full Changelog][changelog]

Thanks to the great work of @sinclairpaul, this release re-instates direct access to the add-on, while maintaining and improving Hass.io Ingress as well! ðŸŽ‰ If you want to enable direct access, you can assign a port for it in the add-on network options.

Ingress got a nice improvement as well! It can now actually be a logged-in user, instead of an anonymous user with limited access.

By default, Ingress uses the user `admin`, if you have a different username you use already, and like to use it with Ingress, set it using the `grafana_ingress_user` option. See the add-on documentation for more information on this.
