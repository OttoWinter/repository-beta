[Full Changelog][changelog]

Major release time! üéâ 

This is an exciting release, as this release adds support for `aarch64` based systems.
E.g., running the 64 bits Home Assistant Operating System on a Raspberry Pi 4 or Hardkernel ODROID-N2! üò≤

‚ö†Ô∏è Please be aware, this add-on can be pretty heavy. On low memory devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi 4 with 1Gb of memory), I would still not recommend using this add-on.

Another visible thing is the rebranding of Home Assistant, which has been reflected on the add-on. The `hassio` command-line tool has been replaced by the newer and updated `ha` version. (Don't worry, I've added a backward-compatible layer with a warning if you still use the old command).

All extensions provided by the add-on, are now marked as "builtin". This means they no longer show up in the extensions list. Other than that, it doesn't change a thing. It makes future updates to the add-on easier.

Also added in this release: Hooking up with the official Mosquitto and MariaDB add-ons (if installed).

If you use the MQTT tools (`mosquitto_pub` or `mosquitto_sub`) from the terminal inside VSCode, they will automatically connect, authenticate and work with the Mosquitto core add-on. Allowing for easy debugging üëç 

For the `mysql` command-line tool, the same has been done. If you have installed the MariaDB add-on, running `mysql` from the command-line, drops you straight in!
