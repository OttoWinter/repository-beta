[Full Changelog][changelog]

Now we are stable, the real fun starts! This version brings tons of new stuff, to improve the straight out of the box experience!

So what is new?

- ESPHome support! Yes! 🎉 The ESPHome project has released their VSCode extension, and is has been added and pre-configured for you! Please be sure to read the additional instructions in the add-on manual.

- vscode-icons have been added. This gives all the files in the file tree a nice little icon that matches the file type. And yes: Home Assistant related files will have a tiny blue house 😉 

- Support for syntax highlighting on log files! 😎 This makes it darn easy on the eyes to read the Home Assistant log file.

- Added the ErrorLens extension, that puts warnings and error right into VSCode, making it easy to spot issues and seeing the "WHY?!" in a blink of an eye. 💯 

- Somehow, the `ping` command was missing 🤷‍♂ So that is now available in the terminal within vscode.
