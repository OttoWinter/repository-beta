[Full Changelog][changelog]

This add-on no longer needs a username and password, you can remove it and it will enable discovery mode, which allows anybody on your network (even with different Spotify account) to use the add-on ðŸ¤˜

However, if you'd like to lock it into your Spotify account, feel free to leave or put the username and password in the configuration. That still works and will disable the discovery mode.

The add-on has some upgrades to prepare for the new Home Assistant Audio handling that is expected soon.
