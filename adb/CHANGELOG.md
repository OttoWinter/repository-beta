[Full Changelog][changelog]

This release fixes an issue with the Android Debug Bridge crashing on start (mainly ARMv7/Raspberry Pi).
It does this by downgrading the `adb` package since there is no workaround available.
No functionality is lost by this downgrade from the perspective of this add-on.
