## Features

This add-on, of course, provides an SSH server, based on [OpenSSH][openssh].
Additionally, it comes out of the box with the following:

- A secure default configuration of SSH:
  - Only allows login by the configured user, even if more users are created.
  - Only uses known secure ciphers and algorithms.
  - Limits login attempts to hold of brute-force attacks better.
  - Many more security tweaks, *this addon passes all [ssh-audit] checks
    without warnings!*

- Comes with compatibility mode option to allow older clients to connect.
- SFTP support is disabled by default but is user configurable.
- Compatible if Hass.io was installed via the generic Linux installer.
- Username is configurable, so `root` is no longer mandatory.
- Persists custom SSH client settings & keys between add-on restarts
- Log levels for allowing you to triage issues easier.
- Have custom Alpine packages installed on start. This allows you to install
  your favorite tools, which will be available every single time you log in.
- Execute custom commands on add-on start so that you can customize the
  shell to your likings.
- [ZSH][zsh] as its default shell. Easier to use for the beginner, more advanced
  for the more experienced user. It even comes preloaded with
  ["Oh My ZSH"][ohmyzsh], with some plugins enabled as well.
- Contains a sensible set of tools right out of the box: curl, Wget, RSync, GIT,
  Nmap, Mosquitto client, MariaDB/MySQL client, Awake (“wake on LAN”), Nano,
  Vim, tmux, and a bunch commonly used networking tools.
