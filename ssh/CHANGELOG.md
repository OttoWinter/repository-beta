[Full Changelog][changelog]

This is a general maintenance release, which incorporates the re-branding of Home Assistant as well.

Newly added to this release is the seamless connection with the MariaDB & Mosquitto add-ons. The command-line tools for these, are automatically configured to connect to the add-ons.

The `hassio` command-line tool has been replaced/renamed to `ha`. Don't worry, the old commands still work, giving you some time to get used to this all.
