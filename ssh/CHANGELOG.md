[Full Changelog][changelog]

Time for a major release! ðŸŽ‰ 

This release upgrades a lot of the internals of the add-on, to the latest & greatest. But wait, there is more!

### Bash support is here!

It has been requested quite a few times since the add-on existed. So if ZSH isn't your cup of tea, disable it in the add-on options by setting `zsh` to `false`.

As an added bonus, Bash completion support is also installed and configured for use with the `hassio` and `hass-cli` commands.

### Faster, but Ingress only Web Terminal

The Web Terminal is now only accessible via Ingress, direct access has been removed. This removes a lot of moving parts from the add-on. Combined with the latest version of `ttyd` (which powers the Web Terminal), it has become lightning fast and responsive.

The Terminal now leverages your browsers WebGL capabilities, making it fly! ðŸš€ 

### Hass.io CLI completion with ZSH

The add-on ships with the latest Hass.io CLI, which now supports ZSH's auto-completion, which you can activate by hitting <tab> twice after you type part of the `hassio` command.

### Other noteworthy changes

- Session sharing between SSH & the Web Terminal is now turned off by default. A lot of new users run into issues understanding how `tmux` works, hence, I've opted to disable session sharing by default.
- Uses base images, based on the latest Alpine Linux 3.11.
- All configuration options regarding the Web Terminal have been removed since with Ingress, they are no longer needed.
