This is a release ships with AdGuard Home v0.99.0!

<https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/releases/tag/v0.99.0>

There are some caveats with this release:

- The add-on **requires** Home Assistant **>= 0.101.0b0** (0.101.0 beta or newer). **You won't be able to update or install this version if you don't meet this requirement.**
  In that case, you will get a `This add-on is not available on your system.` message.
- Home Assistant >= 0.100.0b0 requires at least AdGuard Home v0.99.0 (this release) for the integration to work.
- AdGuard displays a version check error, this bug is expected to be fixed in AdGuard 0.99.1, however, it does not influence the working of AdGuard Home.
