There are some caveats with this release:

- The add-on **requires** Home Assistant **>= 0.101.0b0** (0.101.0 beta or newer). **You won't be able to update or install this version if you don't meet this requirement.**
  In that case, you will get a `This add-on is not available on your system.` message.
- Home Assistant >= 0.100.0b0 requires at least AdGuard Home v0.99.0 (this release) for the integration to work.
