[Full Changelog][changelog]

This is a general maintenance release, however, we gave it a major version bump, because of the upgrade to Python 3.8.

Furthermore, support for providing your own `init_commands` via the add-on configuration has been added, allowing you to customize the environment AppDaemon runs in.
