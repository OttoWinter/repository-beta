[Full Changelog][changelog]

‚ú® This release adds support for Hass.io Ingress üéâ 

Besides Ingress, this release adds major upgrades to motionEye & motion itself ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Create snapshot before upgrade!

If you upgrade from a previous version of the add-on, all your current configuration files need to be converted and migrated. The add-on will do this for you, nevertheless, it is **strongly** advised to create an Hass.io snapshot before upgrading.

### üö®Breaking change

The addition of Ingress makes this add-on not accessible directly. If you have added motionEye via an iframe panel, this release will break that.

However, you can enable this again by going into the add-on configuration. A new section show is visible: "Network". Enter port `8765` (or anything else if you want) in the `disabled` field. Hit the "SAVE" followed by the "RESTART" button to make your iframe work as before.

An option to add an Ingress capable add-on to the sidebar menu automatically is expected to land in Home Assistant 0.92.
