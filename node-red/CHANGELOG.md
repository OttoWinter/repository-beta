[Full Changelog][changelog]

This is a general maintenance release.

ðŸš‘ This release also takes care of mitigating the recently discovered `lodash` vulnerability that is considered high severity. Not all Node-RED nodes have patched and updated to handle this vulnerability, so the add-on does this for you on a higher level. We keep this in place till we are sure all is OK.

More information is provided by Snyk (whom we use to protect and actively scan our add-ons):
