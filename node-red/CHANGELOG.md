[Full Changelog][changelog]

This release updates a couple of parts of the add-on, including nodejs and the Home Assistant WebSocket node.

The add-on now ships with `node-red-node-serialport` straight of the box. I've seen many people struggle to get it installed, so from now on, it is just part of the add-on. :tada:

Furthermore, I've seen people having connection issues, mostly caused by having a conflicting Home Assistant node installed. This release takes care of those conflicting nodes for you. ðŸš‘
