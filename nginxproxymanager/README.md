Manage Nginx proxy hosts with a simple, powerful interface.

## About

This add-on enables you to easily forward incoming connections to anywhere,
including free SSL, without having to know too much about Nginx
or Letâ€™s Encrypt.

Forward your domain to your Home Assistant, Hass.io add-ons, or websites running
at home or anywhere else, straight from a simple, powerful interface.

Want to protect the website with a username/password? Well, it can do that too!
Enable authentication and create a list of usernames/password that can access
that specific application.

For the power users, you can customize the behavior of each host in the
Nginx proxy manager by providing additional Nginx directives.
