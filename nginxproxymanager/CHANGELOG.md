[Full Changelog][changelog]

This is a big major release!

This release upgrades the Nginx Proxy Manager to the latest and greatest, furthermore, it now leverages the official MariaDB add-on to store its data in.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking change

This add-on now depends on and requires the official Home Assistant MariaDB add-on in order to run.

All data of the NGINX Proxy Manager is now stored in that add-on. This removes the need for the add-on to run and maintain its own database server. This reduces memory & CPU usages and makes it easier to maintain the add-on overall.

If you are upgrading, please make sure you have installed the MariaDB add-on (version 2.0 or higher). The NGINX Proxy Manager add-on will automatically migrate your existing data.
